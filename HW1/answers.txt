section 1
in a case of a mere 25 players to assess
 we would reckon it'll take less time to have the assessment done manually, rather than having the script being written
otherwise, in cases in which there are many more players to check
surely we would prefer to trust an automated check
we believe it would have taken us less than 5 mins to check all 25 players
 
section 2
A first and a prompt conclusion is we had lacked sufficient skills for this task
another conclusion we suppose bash could easily enable executing of complicated programmes
Additional application of bash scripts may include complex searching of pre specified field within databases, in the like of 'google'
 
section 3
obviously you could execute this script once every hour manually
you could set an automated clock which executes this script as well
we believe it would be necessary to execute this script even though it may have been executed before
the reason is the times the specified searched field has appeared may change, even if we had checked it
